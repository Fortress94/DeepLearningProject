# Reinforcement Learning: Flappy Bird
This is the original version of our application. The repository is organized in three branches:
- **master**: there is the vanilla version of our code.
- **image_size**: there is the code used for testing different image sizes and network's parameters.
- **prioritized**: it contains the implementation of **rank-based prioritized memory**.

The code is written in Python using PyTorch library.

## Execution

python dqn.py <model>
```
**For instance:**
```
